HOPE - Homogeneous Order Processing Environment

HOPE is a set of tools to automate your trades in financial market. Its
core functions include order/sub-account management, candle generation,
risk management, strategy deployment and back testing.

HOPE is initially  developed for Chinese future market.  It uses CTP[1]
as the default(also built-in) broker's counter system. If you are using
a different one, you need to make an adaptor between HOPE and it.

HOPE is built using open source libraries:

1. Derby[2] - keep user profiles, account setting, position/transaction.
2. Jetty[3] - browser-based UI for management.
3. Common CSV[4] - store/read historical market data.
4. Protobuf[5] - codec engine for internal data exchange.
5. JAXB[6] - read/write data object as XML.

Lucky with your trades.
