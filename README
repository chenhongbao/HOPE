HOPE - Homogeneous Order Processing Environment

HOPE has a complete set of tools to automate your  trading  in financial
market. Its core components include order/ subaccount management, candle
generation, risk management, strategy deployment and back testing.

HOPE is built on top of JMS and speaks FIX[1]  with clients. All its 3rd
party dependencies are open source:

1. Derby[2] - keep user profiles, account setting, position/transaction.
2. Jetty[3] - Browser-based UI for management.
3. Common CSV[4] - store/read historical market data.
4. QuickFIX/J[5] - process FIX protocol, initiator/acceptor model.

Before you start with it, you need to encode the outside data into FIX
format according to the GUIDE, or decode downstream data from FIX format
to outside. Don't worry. It is trivial because I have provided some 
interfaces/adaptors to you.

Lucky with your trades.
